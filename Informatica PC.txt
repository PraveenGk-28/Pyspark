I am Praveen, currently working at Accenture as an Informatica PowerCenter Developer on a telecom domain project. My role involves creating mappings, sessions, worklets, and workflows using both active and passive transformations based on business logic. I have developed SCD Type 2 mappings to maintain historical data and have performed debugging and optimization on these mappings. Additionally, I have been involved in production deployments and code migrations to ensure consistency across lower environments

Debugging: -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fgOfUM9H5I

Normal debugging, Breakpoint debugging.

Normal debugging is to check the instance by processing data through the instance.
Breakpoint debugging: We can check the specific data how is processing through that particular instance.


Optimization: - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QD8XsdzZJ2c

pushdown optimization : Source or target or full.
source : Create index, SQL optimize, partition
Target : drop index, partition, create index

partitioning:

Database 
Round-Robin
pass-through
range key

SCD types: - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjR-3gIu1F0

type -1 - we can insert or update or delete, but we cannot maintain the history here.
type -2 
type -3 

Transformation: 

Source qualifier and filter
filter and router
expression and aggregator
joiner and source qualifier
update strategy 
connected and unconnected
lookup override and sq override

Basic technical questions:

1)mapping parameter and mapping variable

Mapping parameter : it is like declaring, it cannot change the value during session run.
Mapping Variable : it can change the value during session run.

2)data driven sessions.

data driven determine how data should be treated when update strategy is used in mapping by using DD_UPDATE, DD_DETELE, and DD_INSERT.

3)Can we store previous session logs in Informatica.

Yes, we can store previous session logs by setting up in the session properties.

4)output files that are created by the Informatica server at runtime.

Output file, Session log, Bad file, cache and rejected file.

5)target load order?

It specify the order in which data to be loaded into the target when multiple source is mapped to multiple target.

6)Incremental Loading?

It does not load entire data every time, it only load the updated or new data into the target. we can achieve it by using the mapping variable.

7)pmcmd command.

It is in build command line in informatica. used to start or stop workflow, we can start particular task in the workflow by using PMCMD.
by using pmrep we can create, delete recovery the repository folder, object and groups.

8)tracing level.

Normal--> terse --> verbose initialization --> verbose data

9)different types of tasks.

session task, assignment task, command task, email task, event wait task, decision task. 

10)How do you handle error logging.

Enable session logs and set log levels.
Use reject files to capture error records.

11)What is meant by Session Recovery Strategy in Informatica?

it is used for restart the session if it is fails and it will continue from where is fails.

12?What is meant by 'Output is deterministic' and 'Output is repeatable' in Informatica?

output is deterministic : source output does not change between session runs.
output is repeatable : order of the output remains same across session runs.

13)How can you update a record in the target table without using the Update Strategy transformation?

we can use update override in the session properties.

14)How can joins be performed in Informatica without using the Joiner transformation?

we can use "user define joins" in source qualifier transformation properties.

15)What is a Mapplet and how is it used in Informatica?

Mapplet is set of transformation and that can we reusable.

16)What is a session in Informatica PowerCenter?

it is an a task in informatica to run the mapping.

17)What is the difference between a normal and a bulk loading session?

Normal load : It loads data row by row.
Bulk load : it loads entire data at once.

18)How do you handle session failures in Informatica?

Session Recovery: Restarting the session from the point of failure using recovery tables.
Error Handling: Redirecting error rows to an error file.
Workflow Monitor: Monitoring and troubleshooting session failures.

19)What is the role of the session log in Informatica?

The session log contains detailed information about the session execution, including start and end times, row counts, errors, and warnings. It is useful for debugging and performance analysis.

20)What is the significance of the session parameter file?

The session parameter file contains values for mapping parameters and variables.

21)How can you handle session dependencies in a workflow?

Session dependencies can be managed using workflow tasks like Decision, Event Wait, and Event Raise.

22)How can you use pre-session and post-session commands in Informatica?

Pre-session and post-session commands can be used to execute shell commands or scripts before and after the session runs. These commands can be configured in the session properties.
